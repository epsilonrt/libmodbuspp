   * The Modbus master is the only one able to initiate a transaction with
   * the slaves. This class therefore makes it possible to read or write in
   * Modbus slaves.
   *
   * To use, simply perform the following actions:
   * @code
      // instantiate a variable by choosing the network and the parameters to connect to it
      Master mb (Rtu, port , "38400E1");
      // adds a new slave and gets her reference
      Slave & slave = mb.addSlave(33);
      // open the communication
      mb.open ();
      // perform read or write operations for this slave
      slave.readInputRegisters (1, values, 2);
   * @endcode
